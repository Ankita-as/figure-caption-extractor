In twelve-week-old ISS mice we found significantly elevated thresholds at the click (p<0.01) and 32 kHz stimuli (p<0.001), compared to normal hearing, age-matched C3HeB/FeJ mice. The mean thresholds at the 8- and 16 kHz stimuli were not different although the standard deviation (13- and 23 dB SPL) was significantly higher than in the C3HeB/FeJ controls (p<0.001) ( Fig. 1A  ,  Table 1 ). At 26 weeks of age, hearing thresholds in ISS mice were elevated across all tested stimuli (p<0.001), being highest at the 32 kHz and lowest at the 8 kHz stimuli. ILS mice showed normal hearing thresholds at twelve weeks of age. However, at 26 weeks there was a noticeable hearing loss at the high frequency 32 kHz stimulus with a mean threshold of 72±9 dB SPL, which was 22 dB SPL higher than that of C3HeB/FeJ controls (p<0.001;  Fig. 1A  ,  Table 1 ).",

      "caption": "To determine whether the compound auditory nerve action potential is affected, we measured the wave I ABR peak-to-peak amplitude at supra-threshold hearing levels (60 dB SPL at 8- and 16 kHz). In both ILS and ISS mice, we observed a significant decrease in amplitudes at 8- and 16 kHz compared to C3HeB/FeJ at 26 weeks of age (p<0.001) ( Fig. 1B ). For instance, in both ILS and ISS mice, the amplitude at 8 kHz and 60 dB SPL stimuli measured 0.2±0.2 µV (n = 16) and 0.3±0.2 µV (n = 3), respectively, compared to 1.2±0.5 µV (n = 6) for C3HeB/FeJ control mice. To determine whether neural propagation of the ascending auditory pathway was compromised, we measured the latencies of ABR waves I through V. In 26-week-old ILS and ISS mice, there was no significant difference in latencies at the 8- and 16 kHz stimuli compared to C3HeB/FeJ controls ( Fig. 1C ).",

      "caption": "To differentiate the abnormal compound auditory responses, we ascertained the function of the sensory outer hair cells directly by using distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests. In 26-week-old ISS mice, we found complete absence of distortion-products at L1 = 75 dB SPL and f2 = 30–52 kHz. At f = 18–30 kHz, we measured a significant reduction in emission levels (p<0.001), while at the lower frequency range (f2 = 6–16 kHz) DPOAE levels were comparable to control mice ( Fig. 1D ). In 26-week-old ILS mice, we measured a significant reduction in DPOAE levels at f2 = 20–52 kHz, which was most pronounced at the 45–52 kHz range and progressed from higher to lower f2 frequencies ( Fig. 1D ). Emission levels were normal in the lower frequency range in these animals (f2 = 6–20 kHz). To test whether a defect in the stria vascularis could account for the abnormal ABRs and reduced emission levels, we measured the voltage potential in the scala media at the level of the round window. We observed endocochlear potentials (EP) of 104±6 mV (n = 10) and 109±4 mV (n = 4) in 26-week-old ILS and ISS mice, respectively, which was comparable with the potentials measured in normal hearing C3HeB/FeJ mice (94±9 mV; n = 5; p>0.05) ( Fig. 1E ).",

We tested four twelve-week-old mice from each strain using four stimuli. At the click stimulus, thresholds followed a normal distribution, with a mean of 55±17 dB SPL (n = 63). At the 16 kHz stimulus, thresholds followed a bimodal distribution, with means of 28±10 dB SPL (n = 33) and 84±10 dB SPL (n = 30). Thresholds at the 8 kHz stimulus showed a similar bimodal distribution. At the 32 kHz stimulus, threshold values were also distributed bimodally, but the histogram was shifted toward higher mean threshold values of 53±11 (n = 31) and 95±6 dB SPL (n = 32) ( Fig. 3A–D ).

We found highly significant correlations between elevated thresholds at the 8-, 16-, and 32 kHz stimuli and markers on chromosome 10 (rs3682060, rs13480620; p<0.001). The correlation was highest at the 32 kHz stimulus with a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 15.8 and was associated with ISS-derived alleles. The association between click-derived thresholds and markers on chromosome 10 was only marginal, and was below the genome-wide significance level (p>0.01). Additional spurious linkage was obtained with regions on chromosomes 2, 6, 11, 12, and 15 (0.05>p>0.01) ( Table 2 ;  Fig. 4A, B ). To detect QTLs hidden by the strong locus on chromosome 10, we performed composite QTL mapping. However, this did not reveal any additional significant hits. Interval mapping combined with bootstrap testing and a 2-LOD cut-off margin localized the QTL confidence interval to a ∼4 Mb region localized at the 54–60 Mb position on chromosome 10 ( Fig. 4C ). We named this QTL Sensorineural hearing loss 1 (Snhl1).",

A 753G>A polymorphism in Cdh23 (chr10: 59,993,653 bp) has previously been implicated in age-related hearing loss in C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and other inbred strains. To ascertain the genetic location of Cdh23 relative to Snhl1, we determined the allele status of Cdh23753 in the parental and the 63 LXS RI strains. Consistent with the origin of the haplotype blocks, we found that mice of the ILS strain carry the Cdh23753G allele and mice of the ISS strain have the Cdh23753A allele. Among the 63 RI strains, the Cdh23753 polymorphism was concordant with marker rs13480620, except for strain LXS42, which carried the 753G allele in the presence of a profound hearing loss ( Fig. 5 ).",

This QTL interval seems to place Phl2 outside of the Snhl1 interval ( Fig. 6 ). Furthermore, the 101/H strain is closely related to the group of 129 strains. Given the genetic distance between the 129 strains and the eight founder strains, it seems unlikely that Phl2 and Snhl1 are identical or represent allelic forms of the same locus.",
